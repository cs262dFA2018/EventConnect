    <string name="FAQ_string">Login FAQ Procedure To use the Event Connect App, you must first Log in. This Will help you do that. Step 1. Tap on the Event Connect Icon on your phone, it should be a red circle with the outline of a calendar in it. Step 2. Once in the App you should see two entry boxes that says Email and Password and a button that says “Event Connect”. Step 3. Tap on the email entry box and enter your email. Make sure your email has a “@ “and ends with a “.com” or “.edu”. For example, me@.edu. After entering a working email, tap on the password entry box and enter a password that is greater than 4 letters or numbers. Step 4. After you’re done entering your password and email, hit the “Event Connect” button labeled as “Event Connect”. Good job! You are now in the Event Connect app. To indicate your interest in an event, follow these steps: Find an event that interests you in the “Potential” tab or “Confirmed” tab. If you wish to see detailed information about an event, tap the event title or description Tap the interested button You will see a checkmark next to the text “Interested” If the interest threshold is reached for an event in the “Potential” tab, it will be moved to the Confirmed” tab to indicate the event is confirmed. If this happens you will see a message to let you know. App Tabs: Potential and Confirmed Events The Potential and Confirmed Events tabs sort events as either potential or confirmed. All EventConnect events start out as potential events, which become confirmed if enough people decide to attend. Only the event host knows how many people need to come to confirm an event. A guest can tell whether an event is confirmed by finding out which tab the event is in. To find out if an event is confirmed, look for it in the confirmed events tab. If the event is there, it has been confirmed! If not, the event is either still considered potential or the event has been deleted. Creating A New Event One key feature of the application is the ability to create new events. To create a new event, 1. Press the floating Plus button at the bottom right of the app. 2. Add your name as the host of the event. 3. Create a title for your event and add it to the title line. We will call it BirthdayParty. 4. Enter the date by pressing the date line by pressing April 7th in the calendar widget. 5. Enter 9 pm in the timeline. 6. Put 0 for the cost line, since we are assuming nobody has to pay to join. 7. Add the minimum number of people you need to attend in the threshold, and the maximum number of people you can host in the capacity. We will assume we need at least 5 people to come and can host up to 15. 8. Choose a category for the event from the category spinner. 9. Add a short description of the event in the description line. 10. Press Create EventTo rescind interest in an event you previously indicated interest for, follow these steps: 1. Find the event you previously indicated interest in a. If the event was in the “Potential” tab when you indicated your interest, it may have become confirmed since that time in which case it will be found in the “Confirmed” tab instead. 2. You should see a button with the text “Interested” with a checkmark next to it, tap this button 3. You will see the check mark disappear, and the text on the button will read “Interested?” a. If the interest threshold is no longer met for an event in the “Confirmed” tab, it will be moved to the “Potential” tab to indicate the event is no longer confirmed. If this happens you will see a message to let you know.</string>
